Step 1 - The routes
We will create the FastAPI Server
We will need 4 routes: 1 route for register as a user, 1 route for login, 1 route for access public resources, 1 route for protected resources

When user log in, we need to verify the password

We need to encode to create the Token

we need to decode to verify the user when they access protected resources

Step 3 - Data schema

For log in info, we need to standardize it with specific type like string
